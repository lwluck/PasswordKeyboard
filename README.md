# PasswordKeyboard
A Proof of Concept keyboard that will allow a user to easily fill usernames and passwords. The keyboard requires authentication using either a master password (PASSWORD in this proof of concept) or by using TouchID. In order for the keyboard to work, you have to give "Allow Full Access" in the iOS settings app for the keyboard. This will allow the keyboard to insert your passwords into your paste board so that you can paste them into the Secure password fields. It also allows the keyboard to use Touch ID.

## Installation
1. Install the app on your iPhone
2. Go to Settings -> General -> Keyboards
3. Select Keyboards
4. Select Add New Keyboard...
5. Select the "Password Keyboard"
6. Select the "Password Keyboard" again and turn on "Allow Full Access"
7. You now should have access to the keyboard as a keyboard. You can use the actual PasswordKeyboard app to test it or try it out in another app, however, it only has a few test logins saved in it.

## Use
Once installed you will probably want to test the keyboard out. Below is an example of how to use the keyboard.

### 1. Switch to the keyboard by using the Globe button on the main iOS keyboard.
